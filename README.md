# Student-Database-CRUD-Application
A REST API CRUD web app using Flask and sqlalchemy to record student records.

Welcome to the Basic CRUD app in Flask! This project is a RESTful API that performs CRUD operations on a database with fields for student ID, first name, last name, date of birth, and amount due.

Using the Flask framework, we've developed a web application that can create, read, update, and delete student records in the database. Our API utilizes the SQLAlchemy library to connect to a PostgreSQL database and the Marshmallow library to serialize and deserialize data.

To make this app functional, we've implemented several endpoints for our API. These endpoints allow us to perform various CRUD operations on our student records. For example, the GET endpoint retrieves all the student records from the database, while the POST endpoint allows us to add a new student record. Similarly, the PUT and DELETE endpoints update and delete a student record, respectively.

We've also created a user-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our front-end has a form to input new student data, a table to display all student records, and buttons to edit and delete individual student records.

Overall, this project is a great example of how to build a CRUD app in Flask. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of Flask and how it can be used to build RESTful APIs for a variety of purposes.
